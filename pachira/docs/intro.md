# About the Pachira Protocol

Pachira is an Ethereum protocol for mining tokens and distributing rewards.

The Pachira protocol is designed to support Decentralized Autonomous Organzations by allowing anyone to participate in the 
Ethereum ecosystem through a hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.

The protocol is designed according to the following design principles:

1. Proof of Work consensus is the most autonomous mechanism for managing blockchain integrity and token supply.

2. Proof of Stake consensus is the most democratic mechanism for allowing participation in the blockchain ecosystem.

3. FPGA can be used to reduce the overall power consumption of mining and to empower anyone to participate in mining.

4. There are dynamics in each consensus model which are contrary to principles of transparency and equal access. These 
behaviors should be addressed.
   
5. Artificial Value created through pre-minted Management Tokens, investor pre-sales, and Initial Coin Offerings 
are not appropriate and can erode the long-term benefits of Ethereum. A Genesis Mint algorithm is required to create an organic 
   evolution of the protocol as naturally occurs from its own rules, without human interference.
   
## What's Happening Now

We are in Skunk Works mode, but we are very close to being ready to release the protocol.
